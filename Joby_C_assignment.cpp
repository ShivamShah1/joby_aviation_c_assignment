To perform an eVTOL Simulation Problem

There are five companies developing eVTOL aircraft with the some different characteristics.
Trying to simulate using 20 random vehicles with 3 chargers from the given 5 companies for 3 hours,
to calculate the following
- average flight time per flight
- average distance traveled per flight
- average time charging per charge session
- total number of faults
- total number of passenger miles. 

with these assumptions:
- Each vehicle starts the simulation with a fully-charged battery
- Each vehicle instantaneously reaches Cruise Speed
- Each vehicle is airborne for the full use of the battery, and is immediately in line for the charger after running out of battery power.

Intuition and ideology:
All the selected vehicles will have full battery power so all the 20 vehicles will be flying in the air,
so calculating the flight time for all vehicles with full charged battery and the vehicles with the respective 
flight range and time will land respectively and will try to accuire the charging station if free or will wait for its avaibility and 
then set its flight again. We will try to run this scenario for 3 hours.
